# humid-net

A mid-level networking framework for Unity that aims to provide a clean and robust abstraction layer for Epic Online Services, without making too many assumptions regarding the higher level implementation.

>[!NOTE]
>Voice Chat for EOS was implemented outside of the overarching abstraction layer, primarily for testing and debugging purposes as I was figuring out how to map Epic's audio buffer to Unity's audio system for spatialization.
>I might finish the VoIP implementation properly at some point.
